OUTPUT EXPECTED
Enter number of years: 5
---- Interest Growth ----
Year 1: Interest = Rs.50.00 | Amount = Rs.1050.00
Year 2: Interest = Rs.52.50 | Amount = Rs.1102.50
Year 3: Interest = Rs.55.12 | Amount = Rs.1157.62
Year 4: Interest = Rs.57.88 | Amount = Rs.1215.51
Year 5: Interest = Rs.60.78 | Amount = Rs.1276.28
